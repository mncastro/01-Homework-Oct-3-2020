To whom it may concern:

I tooked the codebase you sent me and made sure to edit to code to meet
basic accesibility standards.

I edit and cleaned the code following this set of guidelines:

-Eliminated <div> tags to clean and understandable semantic tags.

-Eliminated or condensed excessive CSS classes.

-Changed website headline and order for easier user readibility.
